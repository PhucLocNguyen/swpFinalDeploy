        Understanding the Warranty Options at Our Store
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        When purchasing a product, one of the most important considerations is
        the warranty. A good warranty can provide peace of mind, ensuring that
        you are protected against any unforeseen issues with your purchase. At
        our store, we offer three main types of warranties: Product Warranty,
        Extended Warranty, and Lifetime Warranty. Each of these warranties comes
        with its own set of benefits and coverage limits.
